# Summary

Parts to Create a Model Railroad Turnout Motor (Switch Machine) Using an SG90 Servo.
Includes a bracket for mounting the servo and a plate to mount one or two SPDT microswitches for power routing or indicator applications.

Two versions (L and R) are possible depending on which microswitch plate is used; not important in most cases, but I had a couple of really tight fits where the opposite hand unit made a difference!

A short video of the finished device in action is included in the ZIP file.

# Print Settings

Printer: XYZ Da Vinci AiO 1.0
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: Good or Excellent
Infill: Default

Notes: 
Best with ABS.

# Post-Printing

Most of the holes should accommodate standard 2-56 machine screws or #2 sheet metal or wood screws. The two holes for securing the servo will accommodate the screws unmodified provided with a standard SG90 servo from eBay or other sources. 

The two holes on the bracket for mounting the microswitch plate work best if  tapped to accept 2-56 machine screws.

One or both of the small pivot holes for the 0.032" music wire actuator may need to be opened using a small drill bit.

# How I Designed This

Original design was fabricated using various thicknesses of sheet styrene, then recreated using 123D Design software.
